## About The App/ How to use:

This is a simple API app that will show you the best astrophotography from NASA! You can select the date you want from the clender and click the 'Ready?' button. 
Voila! You will get the coolest picture of the day and also the explanation of it! 

## How It's Made:

This app was my first ever attempt using APIs. I love NASA and astronomy so when I learned about APIs and found out NASA has an open API that we can use for free I couldn't resist using it!

## Tech Used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript



## Lessons Learned:

I learned the very basics of how WebAPI's work, such as how to send requests and implement the response into my website. It was so much fun and such a satisfying feeling when it worked!
